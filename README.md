# Introduction

This simple python 3.7 script is written to help linguistics students revise Chomsky-Hale features.

## Running

The script can be run like so (the data.csv file must be in the same directory as the chfind.py script):

```
python chfind.py
```

It will prompt the user for input.

Alterntively, the user can run the script with a series of features to be parsed like so:

```
python chfind.py +cons -son -syl -voi
```

## Dependencies

The script will run using the standard library. As long as python 3.7 is installed and the standard library available, there should be no issues.
